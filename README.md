# GhibliFilms Studio Website
 
## The Task
→ Build a website with the data provided from the following API https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/films <br>
→ Styling/Layout on the screenshots must be followed and it must be fully responsive. On mobile, the content can stack with the image above the content. Hint: pseudo classes are used for layering the images.<br>
→ Hover styles on buttons are optional, but might be good to show something interesting.<br>
→ Please add a back button on the single movie pages, so you can return to the overview page.<br>
→ We will need this hosted on GitHub Pages or something similar for us to view.<br>
